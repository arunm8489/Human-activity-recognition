# Human activity recognition
 
 
 This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.


We have divided the problem to 2 phases

Static,
Dynamic

Static containes 3 activities
Standing,
Sitting,
Laying


Dynamic contains 3 activities
Walking,
Walking Upstairs,
Walking Downstairs


First we have to do a simple binary classification for which we can use a decision tree or simple nueral network.Then we have to do second phase of classification using CNN.In second phase we are able to get an accuracy of about 96%.
